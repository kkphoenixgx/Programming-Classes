## "Advanced" CSS proprieties

* `clip-path: polygon( <x y> , <x y...> )`: It clips the div to a polygon format that you define.
	* **polygon explanation**: you can define as much points you want, which point is set  by a `<x>` and a `<y>` that accepts pixel values, percentage values [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/polygon)  and says the div format.

## It is not advanced but I learned in the course

* **`line-height: x`**: this is actually pretty common and I just did not know what it does. *This set font to x times the font value*
* `background-position: value`: set background position to `value`. Value can be a number as `16px` or can be a position, like: `top`.
