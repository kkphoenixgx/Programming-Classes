# Install and run electron

Mod 3 -- **11/01/22**

we can install electron in two ways, how a dependency of our project or globally, and the best way to have it installed is on both, you actually have to has electron as a dependency of your project to run our project but globally you can run it faster than it is installed.

As a dependency of your project:
> npm install electron --save

globally:
> npm install -g electron

And when you have already installed it, you can run it with

* *electron* = to run the electron, a window of it.
* *electron .* =  to run your project, but you have to be in the same directory as your project.
