When you want to communicate between components **from dad to children**, you have to pass, as an element, what you want to pass.

Dad calls the children into his code and pass arguments from dad's code to children parameters:

In children:
![](../../../../Pasted%20image%2020230519181056.png)

And, for instance, what we are using here is just destructing assignment, so, the first value of the element position will be added to position and the same thing as polyhedron as  polyhedron.
