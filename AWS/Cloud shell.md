Cloud shell is the Cloud terminal, you can run commands for terminal inside aws control pannel. It's not avaliable to all countrys but is pretty much the same thing as using console


Probably the collest thing of Cloud shell that currently I do not know if you can do in cli is full access of files and Cloud space. It is exactly like a docker container, you can put files, you can download files, you can create files, is a linux terminal
